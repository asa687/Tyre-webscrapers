This webscraper applies for the 2 websites specified, storing the information into a CSV and database as required. 
Whilst there was difficulty implementing a unified function since each website uses different terms, it could be simplified into a single function template from which the terms could be retrieved 
a random time between 10 - 30 seconds is used as the delay between each scrape in order to be more human and not hammer the website with requests 
One website uses postcodes whilst the other does not, so the decision was made not to record them as for national tyres the categories would be nan.
